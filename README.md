# 🔐 Role-Based Access Control App

A secure full-stack app built with **React (Vite)** and **Express.js**, implementing modern **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** with token-based authentication and clean backend architecture.

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ **User Roles** — Admin & Customer  
✅ **JWT Auth** — Access Token in `localStorage`, Refresh Token in `HttpOnly Cookie`  
✅ **Role-Protected Routes** — Admin can **Create, Read, Update, Delete** users. Customer can only view.  
✅ **Middleware Security** — Auth & Role checks handled via Express middleware  
✅ **Account Management** — Secure Signup/Login with password hashing  
✅ **Modern React Stack** — React + Vite + Axios + useSWR (Vercel Hook)  
✅ **MongoDB Integration** — Lightweight and scalable NoSQL database  
✅ **Clean Folder Structure** — Backend & frontend organized for clarity and scalability
